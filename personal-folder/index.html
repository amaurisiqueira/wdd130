                Exploring Condiments: Seasonal Favorites, Legume Enhancers, and Proper Storage.
            </h2>
            <p class="text_body">
               The idea of developing a website dedicated to the main condiments used in Chile and international cuisine arose from a fundamental question: What are the most used condiments in national and international cooking during each season of the year? We set out to investigate and gather information about the most popular spices and condiments in each season, taking into account both local preferences and international culinary trends. Furthermore, we expanded our inquiry to explore the possible condiments that could enhance the flavor and properties of legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans. We were interested in discovering unique and delicious combinations that would inspire creativity in the kitchen and provide healthy and tasty options for legume lovers. Once we obtained the answers to these questions about the main spices, another equally relevant question arose: What is the appropriate storage time for condiments without losing their aromatic and flavor properties? We researched the best conservation practices, from proper packaging to optimal storage conditions, to ensure that the condiments maintain their quality and freshness for as long as possible. In summary, our goal is to provide our visitors with a comprehensive and reliable resource on condiments, offering detailed information on the most commonly used spices throughout the year, as well as creative ideas for combining condiments with legumes. Additionally, we share recommendations on proper condiment storage to guarantee an exceptional culinary experience with each use.
