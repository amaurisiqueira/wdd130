    Hi there, my name is  Amaur√≠ Siqueira. <br>
    I'm from Brazil, but I've been living in Santiago de Chile for over 26 years. I have a degree in Computer Engineering and a postgraduate degree in Computer Security. I really enjoy the field of computer science and I'm fascinated by learning new things. I work as a <strong>Back-End</strong> Computer Engineer and I handle various programming languages. In particular, I'm currently learning <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> in a course. My favorite hobby is watching movies, although I don't do it very often. I'm open to learning and contributing in a team environment.
